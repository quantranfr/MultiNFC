# This script work with serial devices emitting one line of text at a time (Serial.println), at 9600 baud rate,
# and send messages to a websocket client. Type
#     python -m websockets ws://127.0.0.1:9080
# in a terminal to simulate a websocket client
#
# Input (from serial ports, per line):
#   <readerID>:<cardID>
# Output (to websocket server, if no card on it, the reader will not be included in the message):
#   <reader1>:<card1>;<reader2>:<card2>;â€¦
#
# Properties:
#
#   * send maximum 2 messages every second
#   * no subsequent same messages
#   * robust:
#
#     * filter faulty messages where 1 same card can be on 2 different readers
#     * have to receive 2 times nothing from the reader to consider that there's no card. Actually, this is one of the most important HYPERPARAMETER of this script. Should it be change if:
#
#       * add or substract overhead (time to process each loop, or add/remove readers).
#       * modify the loop's delay in the corresponding Arduino sketch
